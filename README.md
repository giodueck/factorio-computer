# Factorio Computer Tools
The idea is to make several tools and blueprints for my computers built inside the game available. I'll also be adding basic guides for the language and how to use the computer in-game.

## Why?
Because the circuit network allows for turing complete circuits, and because building computers is fun.

Also, loading a program into a ROM is cumbersome if done manually, and unintuitive to do since the game works in base-10.

My aim is to build a set of tools that allows for (somewhat) easy programming and automatic blueprinting.

## How?
The architecture and all the processors' components are based on another game, [Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/), which guides the player in building a computer from the ground up, starting with only NAND gates.

This means the player understands the computer they built, and it has allowed me to build computers in Factorio.
